love everyone music will get better from here shoutout hypnotichords

track 1 - intro 

smoke a bong and play some pokémon 
parents left a couple days ago i really miss my mom
but i don’t care 
cus without them im just chilling
she wear a mask like mf doom
all these hoes are villains 
ig im the hero so give me all the fuckin missions
i hate this world i’ma kill all the politicians
hc we rolling up we just some musicians
people would kill to be in our fuckin position
have no plans music my only ambition 
i always hated math i said fuck the division 
hc first show $5 admission 
just to show ppl we not broke and we winning
recording footage on my 3ds so i can make a documentary 
im so fuckin happy i grew up in this century 
and that i grew up off good media and good fuckin memory
i don’t wanna be a welder i just wanna skate a lot 
and have own apartment, living off some frozen tater tots
leave my tinder date in a fuckin acre lot
i’m taking fatal shots to my brain 
leave me retarded

track 2 - couch

chillin on my couch i eat her out just like some stuffin
she gagging on me like she got mouth of mini muffins
imma grab her cousin and make her watch while i fuckin throw her in the oven 
and make her play percussion 
i’m looking through her vents im a spy just like a russian
the weed that im puffin
leaves my brain buzzin
your just good for nothing
your a stupid fuckin whore
i’m on pinterest 
i know im her least fuckin interest
but i’m different
and she’s just to dumb to see
watching mallrats and clerks
get her back it didn’t work
love that hoe so much i had to throw her in a hearse
and when she’s finally dead i’d be the first one in her purse
im feeling like the love mummy i leave everybody cursed
every new thing i make is my best while ppl liking old tracks and fuckin with my worst

track 3 - kickflippin

watching shows
kickflippin
making dough 
i just wanna go home
bitch 
i ain’t fuckin know shit
bitch im in this shit with my bro hypnosis
throw this on the track list
this is just the bonus
loitering outside
im pissin off the fuckin homeless
hit a boneless
i’m tripping off the fuckin lotus 
plant
i told my therapist no i will never be a sober man
no i can’t 
so imma tune u out and play up on my 3ds
icing out my skate wheelz yk my diamonds
